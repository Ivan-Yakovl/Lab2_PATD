==== Testing MutableArraySequence ====
Initial MutableArray (size: 5): [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
Modified MutableArray (size: 8): [5, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 10]

==== Testing ImmutableArraySequence ====
Original ImmutableArray (size: 5): [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
Original After Append (size: 5): [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
New ImmutableArray (size: 6): [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4]

==== Testing MutableListSequence ====
Modified MutableList (size: 3): [50, 10, 100]

==== Testing ImmutableListSequence ====
Original ImmutableList (size: 1): [10]
Original After Append (size: 1): [10]
New ImmutableList (size: 2): [10, 40]

==== Advanced Checks ====
Immutable same instance? NO
Mutable same instance? YES
